## Project: Taskify

Taskify is a desktop task management application for university students. Using Taskify, students can
manage all their tasks (academics/personal/CCAs) effectively and seamlessly. The user interacts with it using a CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLOC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* ### Major Contributions:
    * #### Implemented the tag-search feature
        * What it does: Allows the users to search for a task based on one or more tags.
        * Justification: This feature makes it much easier for the user to categorise and filter out tasks belonging to a
          certain category. By tagging tasks with relevant keywords, the user can later retrieve all the tasks from 
          the same
          category really quickly instead of manually looking through all the tasks.
        * Highlights: The implementation involved some changes to existing logic and addition of commands and test 
          cases.
        * Relevant PRs: [\#36](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/36)
    * #### UI Design and Enhancement
      * What it does: Designed and enhanced the UI to make it more seamless and user-friendly, while also being 
        simple and functional.
      * Justification: A great user interface is essential to the user experience and will help in user retention 
        and overall motivation to use the app.
      * Highlights: The UI design involved getting feedback from multiple user. The color scheme and layout of the 
        UI was designed to be simple and intuitive. The implementation of the tab feature was quite challenging and 
        involved a lot of research, especially on aspects like shape and dynamic resizing.
