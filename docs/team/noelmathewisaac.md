## Project: Taskify

Taskify is a desktop task management application for university students. Using Taskify, students can
manage all their tasks (academics/personal/CCAs) effectively and seamlessly. The user interacts with it using a CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLOC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* ### Major Contributions:
    * #### Implemented the tag-search feature
        * What it does: Allows the users to search for a task based on one or more tags.
        * Justification: This feature makes it much easier for the user to categorise and filter out tasks belonging to a
          certain gi
          category. By tagging tasks with relevant keywords, the user can later retrieve all the tasks from the same
          cateogory really quickly instead of manually looking through all the tasks.
        * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
        * Relevant PRs: [\#36](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/36)
    * #### UI Design and Enhancement

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.2` and `v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub
    * Managed the issue tracker and milestones v1.1 - v1.4 (4 milestones) on GitHub.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
