## Project: Taskify

Taskify desktop app for university students who have a seemingly endless list of tasks to finish week after week


### Given below are my contributions to the project

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=hengyongming&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
* **UI Mockup:**
    * Provide an initial mock up of Taskify: [\#15](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/15)
* **Morphing of AddressBook:**
    * Refactor Phone class to Description class: [\#32](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/32)
    * Delete Address class: [\#54](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/54)

* **Enhancements**:
    * Set up a basic skeleton for UI: [\#55](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/55)

* **New Feature**: Added Sort Functionality.
  * What it does: It allows users to sort the tasklist.
  * Justification: Allow users to see which tasks are going to soon so that they can prioritize their time accordingly.
  * Highlights: Implemented a comparator for tasklist so that it can sort the earliest date of the task to the latest.

* **New Feature**: Implemented Tab Switching functionality
  * What it does: It allows users to switch between different tabs.
  * Justification: It allows the users to visualize their tasks better.
  * Highlights: There are basically 4 tabs : `home`, `expired`, `uncompleted`, `completed`. A single panel to show
    all the task might be too cluttered. By separating into 4 tabs based on its respective status, users can better
    visualize what needs to be done.

* **Team-based tasks**:
  * Setting up GitHub team organisation and repo
  * Project management:
    *  Created release `v1.3(trial)` on [Github](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.3-trial)
    * Maintained issue tracker on GitHub* 
      
**Documentation**:
  * User Guide
    * Added documentation for the feature `home` ,`expired`, `uncompleted`, `completed`: [\#87](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/pull/87/files)
