# **1. Introduction**

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to describe the design, implementation and documentation of Taskify. This 
document intends for the read to understand the relationship between the components that make up Taskify.

## 1.2 Audience

This Developer Guide is for anyone who wishes to understand the internal software architecture of Taskify.
In addition, the following groups are the intended target of this documentation:

* CS2103T / CS2101 Teaching Team - as a means to evaluate the design, implementation and documentation of Taskify.
* Potential Taskify Developers - as a means to understand the internal structure of Taskify to potentially expand
upon Taskify in the future.
  
## 1.3 Taskify Overview
Taskify is a desktop app intended for university students, optimized for fast typists via a Command Line Interface 
(CLI). Taskify helps users keep track of their tasks with a a clean and simplistic interface.

## 1.4 How to use this guide
This Developer Guide is structured in a top-down manner, starting with the overall architecture of Taskify, followed
by in-depth descriptions and implementations.

For your convenience, use the **Table of Contents** above to navigate to a section quickly.

# **3. Design**

## 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design Taskify. Given below is a quick overview
of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML
Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit
diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of Taskify.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of Taskify in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

## 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

## 3.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TaskifyParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

## 3.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores taskify data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Taskify`, which `Task` references. This allows `Taskify` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

## 3.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taskify/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Taskify data in json format and read it back.

## 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskify.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# **4. Implementation**
The previous Design section provides an overview on the general structure of Taskify. This section dives deeper and
describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## 4.1 Switch between the different tabs

### 4.1.1 Format of command
* `home`: switch from the other tab to home tab. It will throw an error if you are already in the home tab.
* `expired`: switch from the other tab to expired tab. It will throw an error if you are already in the expired tab.
* `uncompleted`: switch from the other tab to uncompleted tab. It will throw an error if you are already in the uncompleted tab.
* `completed`: switch from the other tab to uncompleted tab. It will throw an error if you are already in the completed tab.

### 4.1.2 Implementation

The tab switching functionality is facilitated by the `MainWindow#switchTab(int tabNumber)` depending on which tab you
want to switch to and what tab users are currently on now.

The model manager has 5 filtered task list. They are `filteredTasks`, `expiredFilteredTasks`,
`uncompletedFilteredTasks`, `completedFilteredTasks` and `todaysFilteredTasks`. The first 4 filtered task list is used for tab
switching. All the filtered task list originated from UniqueTaskList.

The following sequence diagram shows how the switching tabs operation works, we will take the Expired Command as
an example to illustrate as the other tab switching commands is similar.

![ExpiredSequenceDiagram](images/ExpiredSequenceDiagram.png)

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for \`TaskifyParser\` and \`ExpiredCommand\` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a switch command like `expired`:

![ExpiredActivityDiagram](images/ExpiredActivityDiagram.png)

### 4.1.3 Design Consideration
* **Current Choice:** Switch tabs based on the tab name.
    * Pros: More intuitive to the user. The tab name corresponds to the status of the tasks for that tab.
    * Cons: User would have to type longer sentence as compared to `switch 1`

* **Alternative Choice:** Switch tabs based on tab index
    * Pros: Lesser things to remember as the format command is `switch index`
    * Cons: Less intuitive as user will have to look up what tab one corresponds to.


## 4.2 View Command
The `view` command allows users to view `Tasks` that have the same `Date` as the input `Date`.

### 4.2.1 Implementation
This command essentially creates a `TaskHasSameDatePredicate`. This predicate is used on `ObservableList<Task>`
in `Model` which filters the list by searching for `Tasks` that matches the given input `Date`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `view` command works. We will assume the user inputs
`view 2021-04-12`, that is, the user intends to view all tasks that have the date 12th April 2021.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)
1. The user inputs `view 2021-04-12`.
2. TaskifyParser identifies this as a `view` command and creates a `ViewCommandParser` and call its parse method
with the arguments specified by the user (in this case, `2021-04-12`).
3. `ViewCommandParser` creates a new `TaskHasSameDatePredicate` with the arguments `2021-04-12`.
4. `ViewCommandParser` creates a new `ViewCommand` with the newly created `TaskHasSameDatePredicate` object.
5. When `ViewCommand`'s execute method is called, it prompts `Model` to call `updateFilteredTaskList()` with the 
`TaskHasSameDatePredicate` predicate.
6. `Model` updates the filtered list based on the predicate.
7. The result of this command is returned, and the success message String from `CommandResult` is displayed 
to the user.
   
### 4.2.2 Design Consideration
* **Problem**: Typing out the entire date might be too cumbersome or unintuitive.
* **Solution**: Use intuitive keywords such as `today` or `tomorrow` to represent dates.


## 4.3 Delete multiple tasks with indices
This feature allows users to list out the [indices](#65-glossary) of tasks to delete.

### 4.3.1 Implementation
This feature is facilitated by `DeleteMultipleCommand`, which is a `Command` that is executed with `execute()`. It relies on `DeleteUtil#hasMultipleValidIndex` as a validity check,
which is done in `TaskifyParser`. If valid, `DeleteMultipleCommandParser#parse` is called, and returns a `DeleteMultipleCommand`.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between classes for a successful execution.
<a name="classdiag">![](images/DeleteMultipleUsingIndicesClassDiag.png)</a>

The following sequence diagram traces the step-by-step execution of deleting multiple tasks with multiple indices.
![](images/DeleteMultipleUsingIndicesSeqDiag.png)

### 4.3.2 Design Consideration

#### Aspect 1: Problem & Solution
* **Problem**: Deleting several tasks with the default delete feature is too cumbersome
* **Solution**: Allow listing of multiple indices after typing `delete` once.

#### Aspect 2: Design of solution
* **Solution 1 (selected)**: Create a new command that is not a subclass of `DeleteCommand`
    * Pros: Decouple the new command from `DeleteCommand` and obey SRP.
    * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Solution 2**: Make the new command a subclass of `DeleteCommand` or include a list of `DeleteCommand` as a field in the new command
    * Pros: Intuitive and easy to understand, easy to implement either solution
    * Cons: Violates SRP

Solution 1 was selected for its better benefits as well as increased testability.

## 4.4 Delete multiple tasks with an index range
This feature allows users to provide an index range to delete all tasks within the range, inclusive of the upper and lower bound indices.

### 4.4.1 Implementation
This feature is also facilitated by `DeleteMultipleCommand`. The execution of this `DeleteMultipleCommand` is extremely similar to that in the
[deleting multiple tasks with **multiple indices** feature](#43-delete-multiple-tasks-with-indices), with the only difference in
the `isDeletingByRange` field in both `DeleteMultipleCommand` objects. This field is used for handling exceptions appropriately in
`DeleteUtil#getTasksToDelete(List<Task>, List<Index>, boolean)`. This field is determined by `DeleteMultipleCommand#parse`, which checks
if the user is deleting tasks using indices or an index range by consulting `DeleteUtil#isDeletingTasksByRange`.

The responsible class diagram for this feature is [here](#classdiag), which is also the same as that in the "delete multiple tasks with indices" feature.

The following sequence diagram traces the step-by-step execution of deleting multiple tasks with an index range.
![](images/DeleteMultUsingIndexRangeSeqDiag.png)

### 4.4.2 Design Consideration

#### Aspect 1: Problem & Solution
* **Problem**: Listing indices individually after typing `delete` to delete many tasks might be cumbersome as well
* **Solution**: Allow users to delete tasks using a range.

#### Aspect 2: Design of solution
`DeleteMultipleCommand` was already implemented to store the indices of the tasks to delete. A simple solution was to parse the index range
its individual indices, and create a `DeleteMultipleCommand` with those indices. Testability might have reduced a little by adding some
additional exceptions to be thrown within the execution of the command, but deleting either by an index range or individual indices seems to
be part of the same responsibility, so it likely does not violate SRP.



## 4.5 Delete all tasks of a specified status
This feature allows users to provide a `Status` to delete all tasks that are of that `Status`.

### 4.5.1 Implementation
This feature is facilitated by the `DeleteByStatusCommand`. It does a validity check by calling `DeleteUtil#isDeletingTasksByStatus` in `TaskifyParser`,
and `DeleteByStatusCommandParser#parse` calls `ParserUtil#parseInputToStatus` to parse the user's input arguments into the desired `Status`, which
is stored as a field in `DeleteByStatusCommand` for use in the execution of the command (i.e `DeleteByStatusCommand#execute`).


The following class diagram shows the relationship between classes for a successful execution. The only difference between this diagram and the class
diagram for the previous two delete multiple tasks features is the name of the `Command` and the command's `Parser`.
![](images/DeleteByStatusClassDiag.png)

The following sequence diagram traces the step-by-step execution of deleting all tasks of a specified status.
![](images/DeleteByStatusSeqDiag.png)

### 4.5.2 Design Consideration

#### Aspect 1: Problem & Solution
* **Problem**: Instead of deleting by indices, users might want to delete all tasks of a specific `Status`, which might be cumbersome with the existing two features for deleting multiple tasks.<br>
  i.e The user might want to clear all `completed` or `expired` tasks quickly, but that would require the user to check all indices of the tasks with the desired `Status`.
* **Solution**: Allow deletion of tasks by their `Status`.

#### Aspect 2: Design of solution
* **Solution 1 (originally)** : Integrate new logic into existing logic in `DeleteMultipleCommand`, since multiple tasks are to be deleted anyway.
    * Pros : Less code
    * Cons : Decreases cohesion in `DeleteMultipleCommand`, makes code less readable, violate SRP.
* **Solution 2 (selected)** : Refactor the new logic (in Solution 1) into a new command
    * Pros : Obeys SRP, cohesive code in `DeleteMultipleCommand` and the new command. Increases readibility and testability.
    * Cons : More test and main code

Solution 2 was selected since the amount of code to write shouldn't be a huge factor in deciding which solution is better. The other factors explained
are much more important.
